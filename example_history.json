    "content": "The Transformer is a model architecture for sequence transduction problems, such as language modeling and machine translation. Unlike other competitive neural sequence transduction models, it relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, removing the need for recurrence. This allows for significantly more parallelization during training and can achieve state-of-the-art results in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight GPUs. The architecture consists of a stack of identical encoder and decoder layers, with each layer comprising two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Residual connections and layer normalization are employed to facilitate these sub-layers. The output dimension of all sub-layers is dmodel = 512."

    "content": "BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It is a language representation model that pre-trains deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. This allows it to be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, and has achieved new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5%, MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7%, SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2, and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1. The code and pre-trained models are available on the Google AI Language GitHub repository."
